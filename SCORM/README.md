
# Creating your copy of the AI 4 ALL courses
All courses were created using the [Adapt](https://www.adaptlearning.org/) course authoring tool. For deployment to the LMS, the courses were exported to the [SCORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model) format. 

You can deploy your own version of the final course packages on a SCORM Compliant LMS (such as moodle), or you can make changes to the course by making use of the adapt tool.
The SCORM materials and instructions on how to use them are given below.

## Deploying based on SCORM packages

To deploy a course based on a SCORM package, use the zip file with the export suffix on the filename. 

For example to deploy the course *Artificial Intelligence for All: Open AI Training Data for Earth Observation* you would use the file
``` text
artificial-intelligence-for-all-open-ai-training-data-for-earth-observation-export.zip
```
For the complete instructions on how to deploy the course materials, see  

```text 
Getting Started with a Scorm Course.pdf
```
## Editing the course text

 To make edits to the course text follow the instructions in 

```text
How to import a course into the adapt authoring tool.pdf
```
