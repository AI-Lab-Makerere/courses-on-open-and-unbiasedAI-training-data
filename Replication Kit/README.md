# Replication Kit
## Introduction

The Animation of the videos was composited using an Adobe software called *After Effects 2020*.
This is simply because most Non-linear Editing software’s (NLEs) cannot achieve the compositing and flexible capabilities of a compositing software like Adobe After effects can.


To replicate or edit the text in the videos, any editor can easily open the working files in Adobe After effects 2020. The working files have been placed in folders with all the components and footage plus audio files that are readily linked and accessible for use in Adobe After effects software. 


The folders are clearly labelled according to the video e.g VIDEO_1 that contains all the working files plus project file for “Video 1”.
The editor opens the After Effects file and do the necessary  changes both to the text and audio files if there is need for replacement.
The editor can then render out the file and further refine it in Premier Pro or any other NLE of choice.
